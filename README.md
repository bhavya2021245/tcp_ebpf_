# tcp_ebpf_
Initial cwnd bpf
These are header files providing access to Linux kernel functionalities related to Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF), socket operations, network types, BPF helper functions, TCP protocols, and network byte order conversions.
 a BPF program named bpf_iw is defined that operates on socket operations (sockops). It takes a pointer to a struct bpf_sock_ops as an argument.

Variables are initialized, including buffer sizes (bufsize), initial receive window (rwnd_init), IP address (addr), initial congestion window (iw), return value (rv), and operation type (op).
The remote IPv4 address is extracted from skops.
The operation type (op) is extracted from skops.
The program switches based on the operation type (op). Cases handle various socket operation callbacks such as receive window initialization (BPF_SOCK_OPS_RWND_INIT), TCP connection establishment (BPF_SOCK_OPS_TCP_CONNECT_CB), and active connection establishment (BPF_SOCK_OPS_ACTIVE_ESTABLISHED_CB).
Overall, this BPF program intercepts and manipulates socket operations based on the operation type, potentially adjusting buffer sizes, congestion window sizes, and other parameters related to TCP/IP networking. Debugging messages are included if the debug flag is set.
